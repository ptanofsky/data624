Consider the the number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, available in the `aus_livestock` dataset.

## Section 1

Use the `ETS()` function to estimate the equivalent model for simple exponential smoothing. Find the optimal values of  
α
  and  
ℓ
0
 , and generate forecasts for the next four months.
Compute a 95% prediction interval for the first forecast using  
^
y
±
1.96
s
  where  
s
  is the standard deviation of the residuals. Compare your interval with the interval produced by R.
