# Part A â€“ ATM Forecast

- Dataset: ATM624Data.xlsx

In part A, I want you to forecast how much cash is taken out of 4 different ATM machines for May 2010. The data is given in a single file. The variable `Cash` is provided in hundreds of dollars, other than that it is straight forward. I am being somewhat ambiguous on purpose to make this have a little more business feeling. Explain and demonstrate your process, techniques used and not used, and your actual forecast. I am giving you data via an Excel file, please provide your written report on your findings, visuals, discussion and your R code via an RPubs link along with the actual.rmd file. Also please submit the forecast which you will put in an Excel readable file.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Read in data
atm_data_raw <- read_excel("data/ATM624Data.xlsx")

# Properly convert the DATE column to match true input
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43230470/how-to-convert-excel-date-format-to-proper-date-in-r
atm_data_raw <- atm_data_raw %>% mutate(DATE = as.Date(DATE, origin = "1899-12-30"))

# Initial output to see data
#head(atm_data_raw)

# Output summary for high level assessment
summary(atm_data_raw)

# Check dimensions to understand breadth of data
dim(atm_data_raw)
# 1474    3
#Cash in hundreds
```

Dates of dataset start at 2009-05-01 and end with 2010-05-14. This indicates 379 dates, which is 14 more than a single year of 365 days.

Dimensions of the initial dataset indicate 1474 observations, which again indicates more than a single year's worth of data. The 3 columns are `DATE`, `ATM`, and  `Cash`. The `DATE` indicates the specific data, the `ATM` indicates which of the 4 ATMs, and `Cash` represents the total amount withdrawn for the given date and ATM.


Cash 19 NA's

Data observations:
ATM1: 3 Cash NA values
ATM2: 2 Cash NA values
ATM3: Only 3 Cash values with something above zero
ATM4: Many Cash values with a decimal, but not all, something weird there, also ATM4 appears to have 1 really crazy outlier


Total by day and see if there is an overall relationship to be understood

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Define as tsibble with DATE as index
atm_data_ts <- atm_data_raw %>%
  as_tsibble(index = DATE, key = ATM)

# Output tsibble to confirm proper format and definition
atm_data_ts %>%
  filter(DATE > "2010-04-30")
```
A closer look at the data shows 14 observations starting with date 2010-05-01 and ending on 2010-05-14 do not indicate an ATM nor a Cash amount, thus these 14 observations will be ignored in the upcoming evaluation. The removal of thse 14 observations also makes for a cleaner dataset, as now the total observations is 1460, which is exacting 365 for each of the 4 ATMs.

## ATM1

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Filter to ATM1 data
atm1_data_ts <- atm_data_ts %>%
  filter(ATM == 'ATM1')

# Output summary
summary(atm1_data_ts)
```

The summary of data for ATM1 confirms the 365 days (single year) of observations and also indicates 3 missing Cash values.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm1_data_ts$DATE[is.na(atm1_data_ts$Cash)]
```

The 3 dats with missing Cash values are displayed above. Not sure the significance of the missing data occurring in a small window of time, so will consider imputation.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm1_data_ts %>%
  autoplot(Cash) +
  labs(y = "Cash (in hundreds $USD)", title = "ATM1")
```

Initial plot of the ATM1 data appears to show a weekly seasonal component along with a dip between October 2009 and January 2010. There does not appear to be a clear increasing or decreasing trend.

### Impute Missing Data

Given the low volume of missing values, three, I will simply impute the data with the median value of the ATM1 dataset.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Calculate median value for ATM1
median <- median(atm1_data_ts$Cash, na.rm=TRUE)

# Set NAs to median
atm1_data_ts$Cash[is.na(atm1_data_ts$Cash)] <- median

summary(atm1_data_ts)
```

Summary output confirms no missing data for ATM1 Cash amounts.

Simply updating the ATM1 data tsibble is defined properly.

```{r warning=F, message=F}

atm1_data_ts <- atm1_data_ts %>%
  mutate(DATE = as_date(DATE)) %>%
  update_tsibble(index = DATE)
#atm1_data_ts
```

### Decomposition

To better understand the trend and seasonal nature of the ATM1 dataset, decomposition is performed.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# From: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/494013/control-the-period-for-daily-time-series-in-tsibbles
atm1_dcmp <- atm1_data_ts %>%
  model(stl = STL(Cash ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=7, window="periodic"))) 

atm1_dcmp %>% components() %>% autoplot()
```

STL decomposition shows the remainder plot has the most impact on the data based on the gray bar on the left. The seasonal plot shows a clear seasonal pattern, but while the seasonal pattern remains the same, the remainder plot shows greater variance toward the end of plot, beginning in February 2010. The trend line confirms no real trend present in the dataset.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
components(atm1_dcmp) %>%
  as_tsibble() %>%
  filter_index("2009-05-01" ~ "2010-04-30") %>%
  autoplot(Cash, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), colour = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "Cash (in hundreds $USD)", title = "Seasonally Adjusted Trendline")
```

The above seasonally adjusted trendline confirms that despite a few outliers through December 2009, the seasonal component does well to address the weekly nature of the data, but the plot above indicates starting in February 2010, the seasonal component does not properly define the dataset. Based on the above plot, a new weekly pattern appears to emerge in February 2010.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
components(atm1_dcmp) %>%
  as_tsibble() %>%
  filter_index("2010-02-16" ~ "2010-04-30") %>%
  autoplot(Cash, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), colour = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "Cash (in hundreds $USD)", title = "Seasonally Adjusted Trendline")
```

Above plot shows that the seasonally adjusted data does not account for the weekly seasonal nature for the last three months. Clearly a shift in the weekly seasonal pattern has occurred.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm1_data_ts %>% ACF() %>% autoplot()
```

The ACF of the ATM1 data shows a clear correlation at lags 7, 14, and 21, which is expected for seasonal data following a weekly pattern.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm1_data_ts %>% PACF() %>% autoplot()
```

The PACF plot re-confirms the correlations at lag 7 and 14. Interesting, correlation also appears at lags 2 and 5.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm1_data_ts %>% gg_season(Cash, period = "week") +
  labs(y="$USD (in hundreds)", title="ATM Withdrawals")
```

To better understand the weekly seasonal pattern, the `gg_season` plot above does show some sort of shift on Tuesday and Thursday.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm1_data_ts %>%
  gg_subseries(period = "week") +
  labs(
    y = "$USD (in hundreds)",
    title = "ATM Withdrawals"
  )
```

The ``gg_subseries` plot confirms the shift in February occurs on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The other days of the week indicate some variance and outliers, but nothing as dramatic as Tuesday through Thursday.

### Train and Test Model

Before forecasting the data for May 2010, I want to train and test the different model functions for proper evaluation. The models are trained on 292 days, or approximately 80% of the year represented.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Create training set (assume 1 year of data)
# 292 days for training, approx. 80% of data
train_atm1 <- atm1_data_ts %>% 
  filter_index("2009-05-01" ~ "2010-02-17")

#train_atm1

# Fit the models
fit_atm1 <- train_atm1 %>%
  model(
    Naive = NAIVE(Cash),
    `Seasonal naive` = SNAIVE(Cash),
    `Random walk` = RW(Cash),
    Arima = ARIMA(Cash),
    ETS_Add = ETS(Cash ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("A")),
    ETS_Mult = ETS(Cash ~ error("M") + trend("N") + season("M")),
    ETS_Damp = ETS(Cash ~ error("M") + trend("Ad") + season("M"))
  )

fit_atm1 %>% accuracy()
```

Using the different model functions from the Hyndman textbook, the best performing model based on RMSE is the ETS model with dampening. Overall, the three ETS models and the ARIMA model all perform well in comparison. The seasonal naive model also performe well with an RMSE slightly higher than the ARIMA model and the three ETS models.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Generate forecasts for 72 days
fc_atm1 <- fit_atm1 %>% forecast(h = "72 days")

fc_atm1 %>% accuracy(atm1_data_ts)
```

The accuracy of the models on the test dataset shows ARIMA performing the best with an RMSE of 50.77. The three ETS models do also perform well.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Plot forecasts against actual values
fc_atm1 %>%
  autoplot(filter_index(train_atm1, "2010-02-01" ~ "2010-04-30"), level = NULL) +
  autolayer(
    filter_index(atm1_data_ts, "2010-02-10" ~ "2010-04-30"),
    colour = "black"
  ) +
  labs(
    y = "Cash (in hundreds $USD)",
    title = "Forecasts for ATM1 Withdrawals"
  ) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Forecast"))
```

So plotting the seven forecasts along with the original dataset shows the seasonal pattern of the forecasts does not match the seasonal pattern of the actual dataset. Based on the observations in the decomposition section, the weekly pattern has changed, and thus training the model on the first 80% of the data actually misses the new pattern found in the data. Further investigation is needed.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
fit_atm1_arima <- train_atm1 %>%
  model(ARIMA(Cash))

# Check the residuals of Seasonal Naive
fit_atm1_arima %>% gg_tsresiduals()
```

To further confirm the assumption of a bad model, I've taken the ARIMA model, the best performing based on RMSE, and displayed the residuals above. The ACF plot of the residuals clearly indicates a correlation exists at lags 8 and 20. This indicates the model isn't quite capturing the correlation of the test data properly.

### Train and Test Model: Second Attempt

Given the decomposition and the model evaluations indicate a change in seasonal pattern sometime in February 2010, I will attempt to train and test on just the data beginning on 2010-02-16. Yes, this certainly reduces the amount of data used to build the model, but I believe may better capture the change in the weekly pattern and thus provide better forecasts for the month of May 2010.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# ATM1 train on 2010-02-16 to 2010-04-30 (end)
# 15 + 31 + 30 = 76 days, 80% is 61 days
new_seasonal_atm1 <- atm1_data_ts %>% 
  filter_index("2010-02-16" ~ "2010-04-30")

train_atm1 <- atm1_data_ts %>% 
  filter_index("2010-02-16" ~ "2010-04-14")

# Fit the models
fit_atm1 <- train_atm1 %>%
  model(
    `Seasonal naive` = SNAIVE(Cash),
    Arima = ARIMA(Cash),
    ETS_Add = ETS(Cash ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("A")),
    ETS_Mult = ETS(Cash ~ error("M") + trend("N") + season("M")),
    ETS_Damp = ETS(Cash ~ error("M") + trend("Ad") + season("M"))
  )

report(fit_atm1)
```

Now using only the 5 top performing models due to the seasonal nature of the data, the ARIMA model performs the best of the 4 models by evaluating the AICc of 447.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
fit_atm1 %>% accuracy()
```

The ARIMA model performs the best on the training set with an RMSE of 16.05, while the ETS Additive performs almost as well as the ARIMA model. The Seasonal Naive model performs third best and the ETS with dampening is clearly not doing well compared to the other four models.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Generate forecasts for 16 days (two weeks), so we'll see if it picks up the seasonal nature
fc_atm1 <- fit_atm1 %>% forecast(h = "16 days")

fc_atm1 %>% accuracy(new_seasonal_atm1)
```

For the accuracy of the five models on the test set, the Seasonal Naive model actually performs the best with an RMSE of 9.64, while ARIMA and ETS Additive, also perform well.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Plot forecasts against actual values
fc_atm1 %>%
  autoplot(filter_index(train_atm1, "2010-04-01" ~ "2010-04-30"), level = NULL) +
  autolayer(
    filter_index(new_seasonal_atm1, "2010-04-01" ~ "2010-04-30"),
    colour = "black"
  ) +
  labs(
    y = "Cash (in hundreds $USD)",
    title = "Forecasts for ATM1 Withdrawals"
  ) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Forecast"))
```

The plot of the test forecasts confirms the models are correctly capturing the seasonal nature of the data near the end of the dataset.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
fit_atm1_arima<- train_atm1 %>%
  model(ARIMA(Cash))

# Check the residuals of ARIMA
fit_atm1_arima %>% gg_tsresiduals()
```

As above, I've displayed the residuals of the ARIMA model to assess the appropriateness of the model. The plot of Innovation residuals appears to follow white noise after the first 10 observations or so. The ACF plot indicates no correlation outside of the confidence intervals.

```{r warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
# Consider Box-Cox
lambda <- new_seasonal_atm1 %>%
  features(Cash, features = guerrero) %>%
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

new_seasonal_atm1 %>%
  autoplot(box_cox(Cash, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = latex2exp::TeX(paste0(
         "Transformed ATM1 withdrawals with $\\lambda$ = ",
         round(lambda,2))))
```

Applying Box-Cox to see if I can squeeze out a little better performance on the test data.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Forecast for May 2010
fit_atm1_bc <- train_atm1 %>%
  model(
    `Seasonal naive` = SNAIVE(box_cox(Cash, lambda)),
    ARIMA(box_cox(Cash, lambda)),
    ETS_Add = ETS(box_cox(Cash, lambda) ~ error("A") + trend("N") + season("A"))
  )

report(fit_atm1_bc)
```

The AICc of the ARIMA model with Box-Cox transformation has improved from 447.73 to 417.98. A promising sign.


```{r warning=F, message=F}
fit_atm1_bc %>% accuracy()
```

The accuracy of the models with Box-Cox show little to no improvement over the models without transformations on the training set. The RMSE of the ARIMA model with the transformation actually increases from 16.04555 to 16.06325 as noted above.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Generate forecasts for the next 16 days
fc_atm1_bc <- fit_atm1_bc %>% forecast(h = "16 days")

fc_atm1_bc %>% accuracy(new_seasonal_atm1)
```

The RMSE of the ARIMA model with Box-Cox transformation on the test data does improve the RMSE compared to the ARIMA model without transformation from 12.812248 to 11.53609.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Plot forecasts against actual values
fc_atm1_bc %>%
  autoplot(filter_index(new_seasonal_atm1, "2010-04-01" ~ "2010-04-30"), level = NULL) +
  autolayer(
    filter_index(new_seasonal_atm1, "2010-04-01" ~ "2010-04-30"),
    colour = "black"
  ) +
  labs(
    y = "Cash (in hundreds $USD)",
    title = "Forecasts for ATM1 Withdrawals"
  ) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Forecast"))
```

The above plot shows the forecasts of the models with transformation along with the actual data. Similar to the plot from the models with transformations, the forecasts do follow the seasonal pattern of the data.

### ATM1 Conclusion

Given the assignment is to forecast the data for May 2010 from the provided data, I believe the models generated from the final two and a half months is the appropriate approach. Clearly, a shift in the weekly pattern occurs in February 2010 and without any additional context or history, I assume that shift will continue through May 2010. As the forecast is only 1 month or approximately four more weeks from the end of the provided data, then I choose to believe that new pattern will persist for the next four weeks through May 2010.

## ATM2

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm2_data_ts <- atm_data_ts %>%
  filter(ATM == 'ATM2')

atm2_data_ts %>%  autoplot(Cash)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Calculate median value for ATM2
median <- median(atm2_data_ts$Cash, na.rm=TRUE)

# Set NAs to median
atm2_data_ts$Cash[is.na(atm2_data_ts$Cash)] <- median

#atm2_data_ts
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm2_data_ts %>%
  model(stl = STL(Cash ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=7, window="periodic"))
        ) %>% 
  components() %>% autoplot()
```

Same thing as ATM1, the seasonal nature of the data changes in the final few months. I'm gonna separate the forecast into just the final section where the weekly seasonal nature shifts.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm2_data_ts %>% ACF() %>% autoplot()
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm2_data_ts %>% PACF() %>% autoplot()
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm2_data_ts %>% gg_season(Cash, period = "week") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y="$ (in hundreds)", title="ATM Withdrawals")
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm2_data_ts %>%
  gg_subseries(period = "week") +
  labs(
    y = "$ (in hundreds)",
    title = "ATM Withdrawals"
  )
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm2_dcmp <- atm2_data_ts %>%
  model(stl = STL(Cash ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=7, window="periodic"))) 

atm2_dcmp %>% components() %>% autoplot()
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
components(atm2_dcmp) %>%
  as_tsibble() %>%
  filter_index("2009-05-01" ~ "2010-04-30") %>%
  autoplot(Cash, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), colour = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "Cash (in hundreds)", title = "Seasonally Adjusted Trendline")
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
components(atm2_dcmp) %>%
  as_tsibble() %>%
  filter_index("2010-02-16" ~ "2010-04-30") %>%
  autoplot(Cash, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), colour = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "Cash (in hundreds)", title = "Seasonally Adjusted Trendline")
```

## ATM3

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm3_data_ts <- atm_data_ts %>%
  filter(ATM == 'ATM3')

atm3_data_ts %>% autoplot(Cash)
```

### Remove data

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm3_data_ts <- atm_data_ts %>%
  filter(ATM == 'ATM3', Cash > 0)

atm3_data_ts %>% autoplot(Cash)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
summary(atm3_data_ts)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm3_data_ts
```

Literally just 3 values above 0

### ATM3 Model

```{r warning=F, message=F}
fit_atm3 <- atm3_data_ts %>% model(MEAN(Cash))
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Forecast for 31 days of May 2010
fc_atm3 <- fit_atm3 %>% forecast(h = "31 days")

#fc_atm1_ets %>% accuracy(atm3_data_ts)

fc_atm3 %>%
  autoplot(filter_index(atm3_data_ts, "2010-04-28" ~ "2010-05-31"), level = NULL) +
  autolayer(
    filter_index(atm1_data_ts, "2010-04-28" ~ "2010-05-31"),
    colour = "black"
  ) +
  labs(y="$USD (in hundreds)", title="ATM1 Withdrawals Forecast") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Forecast"))
```

### ATM3 Conclusion

There's only 3 values with data above zero, so I'm assuming there was absolutely no activity but the ATM3 existed, or else it would have NA.

## ATM4

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm4_data_ts <- atm_data_ts %>%
  filter(ATM == 'ATM4')

atm4_data_ts %>% autoplot(Cash)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
summary(atm4_data_ts)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm4_data_ts %>%
  model(stl = STL(Cash ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=7, window="periodic"))
        ) %>% 
  components() %>% autoplot()

#atm4_data_ts
```


```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm4_data_ts %>% ACF() %>% autoplot()
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm4_data_ts %>% PACF() %>% autoplot()
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm4_data_ts %>% gg_season(Cash, period = "week") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y="$ (in hundreds)", title="ATM Withdrawals")
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm4_data_ts %>%
  gg_subseries(period = "week") +
  labs(
    y = "$ (in hundreds)",
    title = "ATM Withdrawals"
  )
```

### Impute outlier and missing data

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Calculate median value for ATM
# Straightforward approach to impute data

# Set NAs to median
atm4_data_ts$Cash[is.na(atm_data_ts$Cash)] <- median

# Get rid of outlier from ATM4
atm4_data_ts$Cash[atm_data_ts$Cash > 3000] <- median 

atm_data_ts %>% autoplot(Cash)
```


## Overall daily totals across all four ATMs

```{r warning=F, message=F}
atm_data_total_by_day <- atm_data_ts %>%
  index_by(DATE) %>%
  summarize(Cash_Total = sum(Cash))

atm_data_total_by_day

atm_data_total_by_day %>% autoplot(Cash_Total)

atm_data_total_by_day %>%
  model(stl = STL(Cash_Total ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=7, window="periodic"))
        ) %>% 
  components() %>% autoplot()


# Seasonally adjusted plot
atm_dcmp <- atm_data_total_by_day %>%
  model(stl = STL(Cash_Total ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=7, window="periodic"))) 

atm_dcmp %>% components() %>% autoplot()


components(atm_dcmp) %>%
  as_tsibble() %>%
  autoplot(Cash_Total, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), colour = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "Cash (in hundreds)", title = "Seasonally Adjusted Trendline")

```

# Part B â€“ Residential Customer Power

- Dataset: ResidentialCustomerForecastLoad-624.xlsx

Part B consists of a simple dataset of residential power usage for January 1998 until December 2013. Your assignment is to model these data and a monthly forecast for 2014. The data is given in a single file. The variable â€˜KWHâ€™ is power consumption in Kilowatt hours, the rest is straight forward. Add this to your existing files above. 

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Read in data
power_data_raw <- read_excel("data/ResidentialCustomerForecastLoad-624.xlsx")

# Change column name to 'Month'
names(power_data_raw)[names(power_data_raw) == 'YYYY-MMM'] <- 'Month'

# Display first 5 rows for visual inspection
#head(power_data_raw)

# Display summary for initial assessment
summary(power_data_raw)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Display dimensions for assessment
# should be 16 years of data 1998-2013
# Yep, 192/12 = 16
dim(power_data_raw)
# 192   3
# KWH

power_data_ts <- power_data_raw %>%
  mutate(Month = yearmonth(Month)) %>%
  mutate(KWH = KWH/1e3) %>% # In thousands
  as_tsibble(index = Month)

# Output first 5 rows of tsibble
#head(power_data_ts)

# Inital plot of data
power_data_ts %>%
  autoplot(KWH)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# DO I NEED OR WANT THIS PLOT?
power_data_ts %>%
  filter_index("2010" ~ "2011")
```

First observations, data is Monthly, so I'd expect a seasonal component.
1 month is missing KWH has 1 NA value (2008 Sep) Considering imputing with median Sep Value
Outlier (with very small value in July 2010) Considering imputing with median Jul Value

### Impute data

```{r warning=F, message=F}
#power_data_ts

# I want all the September values
sep_data <- power_data_ts %>%
  filter(str_detect(Month, "Sep"))

sep_data <- as_tibble(sep_data)

sep_kwh_med <- sep_data %>% 
  summarise(Median = median(KWH, na.rm = TRUE))

sep_kwh_med
# Median 7666.97
#power_data_ts[power_data_ts$Month == "2008 Sep"] <- sep_kwh_med

power_data_ts[129, 3] <- sep_kwh_med

power_data_ts
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# I want all the July values
jul_data <- power_data_ts %>%
  filter(str_detect(Month, "Jul"))

jul_data <- as_tibble(jul_data)

jul_kwh_med <- jul_data %>% 
  summarise(Median = median(KWH, na.rm = TRUE))

jul_kwh_med
# Median 7678.623	

power_data_ts[151, 3] <- jul_kwh_med

power_data_ts %>% autoplot(KWH)
```

Perhaps a Box-Cox is needed here, there does seem to be increasing variance

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# STL
power_data_ts %>%
  model(stl = STL(KWH ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=12, window="periodic"))) %>% 
  components() %>% autoplot()
```

Redundant with above and below.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
power_dcmp <- power_data_ts %>%
  model(stl = STL(KWH ~ trend(window=Inf) + season(period=12, window="periodic"))) 
power_dcmp %>% components() %>% autoplot()

components(power_dcmp) %>%
  as_tsibble() %>%
  autoplot(KWH, colour = "gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=season_adjust), colour = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "KWH (in thousands)", title = "Seasonally Adjusted Trendline")
```

Seasonally adjusted doesn't look too bad

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Seasonal differencing
power_data_ts %>%
  gg_tsdisplay(difference(KWH, 12),
               plot_type='partial', lag=36) +
  labs(title="Seasonally differenced", y="")

```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# ARIMA model
#power_data_ts %>% gg_tsdisplay()

# https://otexts.com/fpp3/seasonal-arima.html
arima_mod_power <- power_data_ts %>% model(ARIMA(KWH, stepwise=F, approx=F))

report(arima_mod_power)

arima_mod_power %>% gg_tsresiduals(lag=36)

forecast(arima_mod_power, h=36) %>%
  autoplot(power_data_ts) +
  labs(title = "KWH Used",
       y="KWH (in thousands)")
```

### Train and Test Model

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Train on 154 months, which is 12 years and 8 months (80% of the total)
# Total is 192 months (16 years)

train_power_data <- power_data_ts %>% 
  filter_index("1998-Jan" ~ "2010-Oct")
```

Box-Cox

```{r warning=F, message=F}
lambda <- power_data_ts %>%
  features(KWH, features = guerrero) %>%
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

train_power_data %>%
  autoplot(box_cox(KWH, lambda)) +
  labs(y = "",
       title = latex2exp::TeX(paste0(
         "Transformed ATM1 withdrawals with $\\lambda$ = ",
         round(lambda,2))))

# Fit the models
fit_power <- train_power_data %>%
  model(
    Naive = NAIVE(box_cox(KWH, lambda)),
    `Seasonal naive` = SNAIVE(box_cox(KWH, lambda)),
    `Random walk` = RW(box_cox(KWH, lambda)),
    Arima_BC = ARIMA(box_cox(KWH, lambda)),
    Arima = ARIMA(KWH)
  )

fit_power$Arima_BC
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
fit_power$Arima
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
#fit_atm1_snaive <- train_atm1 %>%
#  model(SNAIVE(Cash))

fit_power %>% accuracy()
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Check the residuals of Seasonal Naive
#fit_atm1_snaive %>% gg_tsresiduals()

# Generate forecasts for 38 months, so we'll see if it picks up the seasonal nature
fc_power <- fit_power %>% forecast(h = "38 months")

fc_power %>% accuracy(power_data_ts)
```

```{r warning=F, message=F}
# Plot forecasts against actual values
fc_power %>%
  autoplot(power_data_ts, level = NULL) +
  autolayer(
    filter_index(power_data_ts, "1998-Jan" ~ "2010-Oct"),
    colour = "black"
  ) +
  labs(
    y = "KWH (in thousands)",
    title = "Power Forecast"
  ) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Forecast"))


# Result: Not good, SNAIVE at least attempts the seasonal nature
```

ARIMA_BC is the best RMSE
Need to try the ETS


# Part C â€“ Waterflow (optional)

- Dataset: Waterflow_Pipe1.xlsx and Waterflow_Pipe2.xlsx

Part C consists of two data sets. These are simple 2 columns sets, however they have different time stamps.  Your optional assignment is to time-base sequence the data and aggregate based on hour (example of what this looks like, follows).  Note for multiple recordings within an hour, take the mean.  Then to determine if the data is stationary and can it be forecast.  If so, provide a week forward forecast and present results via Rpubs and .rmd and the forecast in an Excel readable file.
